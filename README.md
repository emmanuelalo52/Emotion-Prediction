# Text Analysis and Classification with Transformers

Text analysis and classification tasks using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The code covers a wide range of tasks, including dataset loading, preprocessing, tokenization, model embeddings, dimensionality reduction, and text classification.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the code on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries and tools installed:

- Python 3.x
- Hugging Face Transformers
- PyTorch
- scikit-learn
- UMAP
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install transformers torch scikit-learn umap-learn pandas matplotlib numpy
```

### Running the Code

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emmanuelalo52/transformers-text-analysis.git
cd transformers-text-analysis
```

2. Run the Python script `text_analysis.py`:

```bash
python text_analysis.py
```

The script will walk through various steps for text analysis, tokenization, embeddings, classification, and visualization.

## Code Overview

Here's a brief overview of what the code does:

1. **Dataset Loading**:
   - Imports necessary libraries.
   - Lists available datasets from the Hugging Face hub.
   - Loads the 'emotion' dataset.

2. **Data Exploration**:
   - Displays dataset information.
   - Accesses and explores dataset columns and features.
   - Converts the dataset to a Pandas DataFrame for better readability.

3. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Maps integer labels to their corresponding emotion names.
   - Creates a bar chart to visualize the frequency of emotions.
   - Adds a new column to count the number of words in each tweet and creates a boxplot to visualize word count distribution.

4. **Text Tokenization and Encoding**:
   - Tokenizes text using a pre-trained tokenizer.
   - Converts tokens back to text.
   - Extracts model input names and tokenizes the entire dataset.

5. **Text Embeddings**:
   - Loads a pre-trained model for text classification.
   - Extracts hidden states for each text sample in the dataset.
   - Performs dimensionality reduction using UMAP.
   - Visualizes text embeddings using hexbin plots.

6. **Text Classification**:
   - Trains a logistic regression classifier and evaluates its accuracy.
   - Computes the F1 score.
   - Trains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and visualizes a confusion matrix.
